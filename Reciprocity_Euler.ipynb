        "\n",
        "In this exploration, we will be examining which primes can be written as a sum of squares in the form: $p=x^2+Ny^2$, where $p$ is an odd prime and $N$ is a positive integer. This is an extention from Fermat's \"Christmas Theorem\" which states that an odd prime $p$ can be expressed as a sum of two squares if and only if $p \\,\\%\\, 4$ is congruent to 1. Euler later looked at $p=x^2+Ny^2$ and like Fermat, found what we call a reciprocity law, a theorem saying that a prime can be written as $p=x^2+Ny^2$ if and only if $p \\,\\%\\ M$ belongs to a finite set. This exploration will be using code to follow in his footsteps, focusing on $M=4N$. The following code below gives us a list of primes of up to a given value, using a method similair to the Sieve of Eratosthenes. We will choose the primes up to $1000000$, the first $78498$ primes.\n",

        " When checking for multiple different $N$'s of positive integers, (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and more) it can be seen that not all possible remainders of $p \\,\\%\\, 4N$  occur. First, we observed that all remainders are odd, and that all $N$'s appear to have $1$ as a possible remainder. Furthermore, the upper bound for the remainders is naturally $4N-1$ as going any higher wouldn't be possible. As for the number of remainders, we observed that as $N$ grows in size the possibilities of the number of remainders also grows, and hence in some cases there are more possible remainders with a larger $N$. However, this correlation is rather weak and you cannot necessarlily say that for a larger $N$ there are a larger amount of remainders. For example, when we try $N=9$ we get $1,13,25$ as our remainders. Looking at $N=80$ we get $16$ different remainders, a fair amount more than  for $N=9$.  But if we try $N=90$ we get a smaller amount of only 12 different remainders."

We start with a list that we call primes that succeed, and a dictionary to count the remainders. We check of our primes and if our `Euler_alt` function outputs true we add that `p` to the list.

This makes sense as when we input different  positive integers they will be further apart since $x^3$ grows faster. Also the pattern that the count of each remainder is roughly the same breaks down, with some remainders being more common than others.\n",

        "Referring back to the modern perspective of Fermat’s “Christmas Theorem”, we were able to generate different codes that represent the reciprocity law. While examining the theorem of reciprocity law, which is, a prime number $p$ can be expressed as $x^2 + Ny^2$ if and only if $p \\, \\%\\ M$ belongs to a certain finite set, we were able to show different codes to generate more reciprocity laws. As we look back onto these new codes that were created, we were able to examine the prime numbers and the remainders within the formula $x^2 +Ny^2$. Within these codes we then found how different methods, such as using the sqrt, can make a code more efficient with what it is we are wanting to find, which is what we can take comprehend from the above construct codes.   \n"
